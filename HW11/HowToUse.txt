How to use the String testing code:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Unpack test.tar, inside you should find directory containing the files:

    main32.o          - compiled main program (32-bit)
    main64.o          - compiled main program (32-bit)
    bytes.h           - Bytes type header file
    string_type.h     - String type header file
    txtfile.h         - Text file type header file
    test_string.py     - python script that runs all the tests in gdb
    pexpect.py        - you can ignore this file

2.  Copy your bytes.c, string_type.c, and txtfile.c files into the directory.

3.  Compile your code with the test code.

    For a 32-bit build:
       gcc -o driver -std=c99 -Wall -ggdb3 -m32 main32.o bytes.c string_type.c txtfile.c

    For a 64-bit build (this is what almost every one wants):
       gcc -o driver -std=c99 -Wall -ggdb3 -m64 main64.o bytes.c string_type.c txtfile.c

    It should not matter which you use, but you may not be able to perform a 
    32-bit build if you installed a 64-bit version of Linux (w/o installing 
    some additional libraries).

4. Run the python test script.

    To intialize or make different tests (so do this first): 

    [prompt]$ python test_string.py 

    To run your code with the test:

    [prompt]$ python test_string.py ./driver 

    This is the same test code used on the Curator. Make sure to look at
    gdbOutput.txt, it will give you a hint as to if/where your code crashes.

5.  When you modify your .c files, remember to compile again.
